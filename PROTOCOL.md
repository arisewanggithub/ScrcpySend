# ScrcpySend / ScrcpyRecv wire protocol

Framing version field: **3**. This is a protocol compatibility discriminator,
separate from application release versions.
ScrcpySend / ScrcpyRecv use plain TCP control: no TLS, authentication, QR, permanent peer identity,
credential issuance, saved trust or revocation. Anyone on the LAN can observe or
forge discovery/session/media traffic. Use ONLY a trusted private family LAN.
No human session code, pairing code, peer credential or comparison confirmation
exists. Internal cast session IDs, message error `code` fields, track IDs and
generations identify internal resources. Sender capture uses Android MediaProjection;
receiver has no dependency on the sender's capture implementation.

## Listener selection and discovery

Receiver prominently displays actual IP addresses, with name as a label. Normal
receiver UI may hide port/settings; TCP27184 remains in discovery/internal
configuration and sender manual-address compatibility. Sender selects an
endpoint by actual UDP source IP + TCP port, with name as a label only, never
identity. One cast at a time; busy never evicts a cast.

Every 2s broadcast UTF-8 JSON to UDP 27183 (<=1024 bytes):

```json
{"protocol":"screencopy","version":3,"name":"Living room","port":27184,"state":"available"}
```

Name 1..80 characters; port integer1..65535;
state available/busy. Ignore unknown fields, never use an advertised host. Sender
lists packet SOURCE IP + name + port/state. Key by source IP+TCP port, update
name/state on fresh datagrams, expire after6s, at most64 entries. Select directly
or manually enter IP/address+port. No compare checkbox/modal or public code.
A listener restart at the same endpoint does not invalidate selection by itself.
Discovered expiry/unavailable state is reported; never silently redirect to a
different IP/port merely because its name matches. Actual connection and BUSY
responses remain authoritative; manual endpoints may lack discovery entirely.
Do not persist peer selection or inferred acceptance. Capture settings persist.
Unknown JSON fields (including human `code`/`sessionCode` fields in a
HELLO/discovery object) are IGNORED, never interpreted/validated as identity.
Wire/discovery versions must be 3; other values are rejected/ignored.

## Connection and session setup

Default TCP **27184**, configurable. TCP_NODELAY. Plain TCP only, no dual-mode
TLS autodetection. One bidirectional connection/one session. Sender connects and
sends HELLO first, session/track/generation0, PTS-1:

```json
{"role":"sender","versions":[3],"name":"ScrcpySend"}
```

Receiver validates role/version/name and returns HELLO session0:

```json
{"role":"receiver","versions":[3],"name":"Living room"}
```

Sender requires wire protocol version 3/role/name (1..80 chars). This is protocol setup, not
authentication. Then sender SESSION_REQUEST uses a new random positive
signed64 session ID and requested settings JSON below. No AUTH message exists:
type2 is RESERVED and MUST reject before payload allocation. Receiver checks
busy/config and returns SESSION_ACCEPT `{"tracks":[1,2]}` (or `[1]` audio off)
or REJECT `{"code":"BUSY","message":"Receiver already playing"}` /
UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG, with matching session. Receiver can reply REJECT BUSY at
HELLO/session0 too. Capture starts ONLY
after SESSION_ACCEPT. Enabled audio cannot silently disappear.

An optional HELLO boolean `videoRotation` negotiates per-picture presentation
rotation. The sender requests it with `true`; a supporting receiver echoes
`true`. Absent/false retains legacy dimension-changing video, with zero rotation
bits. Present non-boolean values are protocol errors. Both peers must agree
before nonzero rotation bits are sent. Discovery and application versions do
not imply support.

Incorrect version fields fail VERSION immediately. TLS ClientHello fails magic immediately.
Do not wait for a complete40-byte header to reject invalid magic/version. Setup and
individual startup phases10s overall (trickled reads do not extend); writer10s.

## Media transport

Custom TCP is the only supported transport. SESSION_REQUEST omits
`mediaTransport`; SESSION_ACCEPT must omit it too. An unexpected transport
descriptor in the acceptance fails explicitly before capture starts.
Control, configuration and encoded media share the same TCP connection.

## TCP binary framing

Exactly40-byte header, big endian:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
|0|4 ASCII bytes `SCPY`|
|4|u16 version **3**|
|6|u16 type|
|8|u32 payload length excluding header|
|12|u32 flags:bit0 video keyframe; negotiated bits1-2 clockwise quarter-turns|
|16|u64 session, positive signed64 range;0 before SESSION_REQUEST|
|24|u32 track0 control,1 video,2 audio|
|28|u32 generation,1..2147483647 on track messages,0 control|
|32|i64 PTS microseconds; -1 controls/config|

Types:1 HELLO, **2 reserved/reject**,3 SESSION_REQUEST,4 SESSION_ACCEPT,5 REJECT,
6 STREAM_CONFIG,7 STREAM_READY,8 VIDEO_FRAME,9 AUDIO_PACKET,10 STATUS,11 ERROR,
12 PING,13 PONG,14 STOP,15 SESSION_END. Directions/responsibilities:
sender sends REQUEST/CONFIG/media, receiver sends ACCEPT/REJECT/READY; other
status/liveness/stop messages bidirectional. Only CONFIG/READY/media have
nonzero track/generation AND require session>0. Video track1; audio track2.
Media PTS>=0, config/control PTS-1. Flags are zero except on VIDEO_FRAME:
bit0 indicates keyframe; with negotiated `videoRotation`, bits1-2 encode
0/90/180/270 degrees clockwise (`flags >> 1` times 90). All other bits are
reserved. Without negotiation rotation bits must be zero. Rotation belongs
to that encoded picture's PTS, not control arrival time. Decode the same coded
width/height/CSD and rotate only when presenting that decoded picture, including
latest-picture catch-up. Rotation alone does not change generation or require
STREAM_CONFIG/STREAM_READY. Natural-coordinate crops and encoded dimensions
remain fixed; manual capture-orientation overrides become presentation rotation.
For negotiated sessions, receiverOrientation `auto` follows the displayed video
aspect (coded dimensions plus picture rotation). Explicit portrait/landscape
still wins. Legacy sessions retain OS-policy Auto behavior. This is scoped to
the receiver Activity; teardown restores the previous orientation policy.
Validate
header fields and bounds BEFORE allocation: controls/config<=65536, video<=4194304,
audio<=262144; no zero-length media. Unknown version/type/flags/invalid track
fatal. Exact reads across segmentation, preserve coalesced frames. EOF partway
through header/payload is error. Controls/config UTF-8 strict JSON objects;
reject duplicate keys, malformed UTF-8, surrogate errors, NaN, coercion or
non-integer/out-of-signed32 numbers unless explicitly otherwise. Ignore unknown
object fields but validate required field types/enums. Media binary, not Base64.

## Requested settings

```json
{"video":{"codec":"h264","encoder":"","bitrate":8000000,"maxSize":1920,"maxFps":60,"displayId":0,"orientation":"0","crop":null,"codecOptions":""},"receiverOrientation":"auto","audio":{"enabled":true,"codec":"opus","encoder":"","bitrate":192000,"source":"output","codecOptions":""}}
```

Video h264/h265/av1; audio opus/aac/raw. Encoder empty means explicit automatic.
The sender requires official hardware-accelerated/nonsoftware encoder flags only
for video. Opus/AAC accepts all compatible encoders, hardware or software.
Saved automatic resolves to an eligible explicit name before
negotiation/preflight/launch without changing persisted preferences. A saved
software video/unavailable selection, absent hardware video encoder or absent
compatible audio encoder fails explicitly; there is no automatic codec/audio-off
fallback or software video fallback. Raw PCM is unencoded,
not hardware-accelerated. This sender policy does not restrict receiver decoders.
Bitrates bits/s; maxSize0 unlimited or<=16384; maxFps1..240; displayId>=0.
Orientation0/90/180/270 or @0/@90/@180/@270; crop null or
`{"width":1280,"height":720,"x":0,"y":0}` natural-display coordinates, positive
size/nonnegative offsets. codecOptions are validated typed numeric MediaCodec options,
never arbitrary shell text. Receiver evaluates decodability, not encoder names.
No substitutions, B-frames forbidden. Raw ignores bitrate (field still positive).
Defaults H264 + enabled Opus192000; no sender Opus encoder is an explicit error.
Sender supports H264/H265/AV1 and Opus/AAC-LC/PCM; enabled PCM is Custom TCP only.

Optional top-level `receiverOrientation` is exactly one of the case-sensitive
strings `auto`, `landscape`, `portrait`; absent means `auto`. Present null,
non-string or any other value is invalid requested configuration and is rejected
with `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG`. Senders emit the selected value, including `auto`.
This optional field uses wire protocol version 3.

The field controls only the receiver's presentation orientation for that accepted
session. `auto` leaves the receiver's normal automatic presentation policy;
`landscape`/`portrait` request the corresponding receiver presentation axis.
Apply the requested axis on entering Playing, not while idle or deciding whether
to accept a request. Orientation-only configuration changes must not recreate
the receiver Activity or disconnect the cast; handling orientation/screen-size
configuration changes in place is permitted. Genuine unrelated Activity teardown
or Surface loss retains existing ownership and synchronous decoder-retirement
rules; this extension does not require retaining a cast across arbitrary
Activity recreation. The receiver restores its prior presentation policy on
terminal/exit, and `auto` applies no override. It must not leak a forced
orientation into a later automatic session. This field is independent of
`video.orientation` (source capture), does not rotate encoded content, and does
not alter STREAM_CONFIG dimensions, media bytes, generation/track IDs, PTS or
readiness. Aspect-fit presentation still uses actual encoded dimensions.
Deterministic schema cases are in
[`receiver-orientation.json`](protocol/fixtures/receiver-orientation.json).

## Config, media, generations and readiness

STREAM_CONFIG JSON per track, generation1 initially:

```json
{"codec":"h264","width":1920,"height":1080,"csd":["AAAAAWdkACg=","AAAAAWju"]}
```

Actual dimensions1..16384. CSD standard canonical padded Base64 buffers:
H264 AnnexB SPS/PPS (one or separate buffers), H265 combined AnnexB VPS/SPS/PPS,
startcodes preserved. Each video frame one complete AnnexB AU, not AVCC/hvcC.
AV1 low-overhead OBU media, sequence-header OBU CSD, no IVF/container.
New config increments ONLY that track generation sequentially. Drain ordered
old media before new CONFIG; no old generation media thereafter. Rotation
updates actual SPS-derived dimensions; unchanged audio generation stays valid.

Opus config:

```json
{"codec":"opus","sampleRate":48000,"channels":2,"csd":["T3B1c0hlYWQBAjgBgLsAAAAAAA=="],"codecDelayNs":6500000,"seekPrerollNs":80000000}
```

csd[0] canonical19-byte RFC7845 OpusHead, version1, channels1/2, mapping0, NOT
Android AOPUSHDR/DLY/PRL wrappers or Ogg. LE preSkip u16offset10, inputRate
u32offset12, gain i16offset16. rate ALWAYS48000; channels must match header.
codecDelayNs=floor(preSkip*1e9/48000), preroll80000000. Receiver applies preSkip
once per generation and output gain. Each AUDIO_PACKET one raw Opus packet.
PTS names the source-clock observation for the decoded packet before preSkip;
receiver trims startup samples. Opus packet/decode order is arrival order, not
PTS order: compatibility permits nonnegative Opus timestamp reversals.
The MediaProjection sender preserves Android MediaCodec output timestamps and
does not reorder packets or independently zero track clocks.
AAC-LC48k stereo config csd[0] AudioSpecificConfig, raw AU packets, no ADTS.
PCM config `{"codec":"raw","sampleRate":48000,"channels":2,"csd":[],"sampleFormat":"s16le"}`;
packets interleaved signed16LE, lengths divisible by4.

Receiver sends STREAM_READY matching session/track/generation `{"ok":true}`
only after resources initialized. Sender buffers but sends no ordinary media
until ALL enabled tracks initially ready, timeout10s. New track generations
pause that track until READY; other tracks may continue. Reject stale generations.
Config packets never masquerade as media. Decoder failure explicit.

PTS use the shared monotonic capture-clock microseconds, not Unix time, not
separately zeroed tracks; may start large. Video, AAC and PCM PTS are
nondecreasing per generation, equal allowed. Opus source PTS must be nonnegative
but may decrease anywhere within a generation, without a magnitude/startup
threshold. Identify Opus only by the exact string `"opus"` in the accepted
audio STREAM_CONFIG `codec`; other or missing codec values grant no exception.
Retain every packet, payload, PTS and arrival/decode order; do not sort, drop,
clamp, duplicate or create generations to hide source-clock reversals.
Receiver maps source observations against increasing decoded sample positions
to monotonic presentation, audio master when enabled; preserve initial A/V
offsets and apply preSkip once per generation. No B-frame reordering.

Both applications must preserve Opus source order and accept nonnegative PTS
reversals. A wire protocol version match alone does not establish this behavior.
`protocol/fixtures/opus-pts-order.json`
is the shared source-order acceptance fixture.

## Liveness, stop, errors, bounds

PING/PONG `{"nonce":123}`, echo signed32 integer. Either peer sends at least
every2s idle, any valid incoming traffic updates liveness,10s no traffic fatal.
One serialized writer and independent reader/watchdog. STOP `{"reason":"user"}`
stops both tracks/capture; SESSION_END echoes reason and closes within2s.
Disconnect/EOF/error closes resources, no old-session resume. New attempt uses a
new positive cast session ID and an explicitly selected/manual endpoint.

STATUS `{"state":"Streaming","message":"..."}` diagnostic.
ERROR `{"code":"AUDIO_FAILED","message":"...","fatal":true}` terminal if fatal.
REJECT always terminal. Codes VERSION, BUSY, UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG,
PROTOCOL, CAPTURE_FAILED, AUDIO_FAILED, DECODER_FAILED, TIMEOUT, CONGESTION, INTERNAL.
AUTH_FAILED is not a wire protocol version 3 error code. No remote phone input/control.

Sender aggregate media<=8MiB AND<=500ms PTS span/track, encoded receiver same
maximum (stricter allowed if explicit CONGESTION).
Track PTS span is maximum minus minimum across queued media plus the proposed
packet, not last minus first in arrival order; configurations do not contribute.
Controls/config64 entries/256KiB. Decoded video<=3frames/audio<=250ms. One in-progress max-size frame
additional, OS socket buffers measured separately. Fair round-robin media,
controls prioritized. Exceeded bounds stop explicitly, no arbitrary dependent
video dropping or unbounded latency. Sender nonsticky foreground service.
All streams, threads, guardian and capture resources cleaned on stop/error.

## Fixtures

`protocol/fixtures/v3.json`: deterministic exact framing cases, including invalid
versions 1/2, reserved type 2 (AUTH), malformed and valid frames. `discovery.json`, `session.json`
test source-address/code-free HELLO/internal-session shapes; `opus-head.hex` and
`track-lifecycle.json` provide initialization/readiness/generation examples.
Synthetic media/config fixtures are framing/schema tests, not playable content.
